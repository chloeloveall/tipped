## Setup and Installation Requirements

### Prior to Installation

#### Confirm you have Git installed

  * Installing Git on Macs:
    * Install the package manager [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by copying and pasting the following in the terminal: ```$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```
    * Copy and paste once of the following lines in the terminal so that Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same packages:
      * For bash users: ```$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile```
      * For zsh users: ```$ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.zshrc```
    * Last, install Git with the following terminal command: ```$ brew install git```

  * Installing Git on Windows:
    * Open Command Prompt, the Windows terminal program. You can access it by typing ```Cmd``` in the search bar in the bottom left corner.
    * **NOTE** There are many options available, but we recommend using a free program called [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    * Navigate to [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) and click on the Download button. This will take you to a page with the latest version of Git Bash. Determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by following these instructions. Then download the corresponding exe file from the Git for Windows site. (If you have a package manager already installed, you can also choose to download the tar.bz2 version.)
    * Click on the downloaded file and then follow the instructions in the Setup menu until you reach the Install button and install the package.
